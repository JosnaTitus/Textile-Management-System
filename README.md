                                                         Textile Management System
                                                                
The main goal of the project is to reduce the workload of the industry.
It keeps track of every module like employees, products, etc.
To understand the project I hade added the synopsis which will give a clear idea like how the project works.

I have used:-

            Visual Basic in the front-end 
            Ms-Access as the back-end.
            
The project can be run from the "login" or the "main" page. 

The login page ask for username and password if entered correctly you will be able to use the other details for safety measures.
